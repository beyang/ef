====

- Use $CDPATH

Other things that may/may not be useful
------------
- Store a history file, so we can reference this, too, to guess which directory to go to
- Make more configurable (e.g., `.findpath` in $HOME), so it can search particular directories first
- Interactive option when multiple options available
